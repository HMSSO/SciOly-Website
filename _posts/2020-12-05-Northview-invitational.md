Hopefully you had an enjoyable weekend and, for those students that participated in the Northview Invitational, hopefully the experience was positive.  We are going to have a Zoom **team meeting this Friday night at 6pm** with all of the students, event mentors, and NEOHSTEM Ambassadors so that we can talk about aspects of the Invitational that went well, areas that were challenging, and then hopefully we can generate some tips and tricks to consider as we begin to prepare for the start of the season in January. [The zoom link was emailed to you.]

We will also have a Zoom **team meeting on Saturday, December 19th at 7pm** to watch the Results Ceremony from the Northview Invitational.  I will screen-share the video so we can all watch it together.  Look for a reminder email with a link next week.

 

Take care, stay safe, and keep studying!

 

All of the best,


Dr. Renna and the NEOSTEM Ambassadors
