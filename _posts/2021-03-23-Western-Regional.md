What an exciting day for the Hudson Middle School Science Olympiad program!  We have won our first ever Regional Tournament!  There were 34 teams total in the Western Ohio Regional Tournament, and we finished in 1st and 5th place.  56 student medals from 27 events, including eight 1st place medals!

 

Over a year of hard work, battling through the pandemic, our students have persevered.  We are so proud and excited for the accomplishments of our students!  We are extremely grateful for the efforts of the event mentors, the Hudson Middle School Administration including Mr. Ganz and Mrs. McCoy, as well as our sponsors, the Northeast Ohio STEM Alliance and the Hudson Kiwanis Foundation.  We truly are a community program and together our students are continuing to achieve great feats.
