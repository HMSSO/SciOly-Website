Demo Markdown
```
This is just a sample. 

Markdown
-------------

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
  - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!
