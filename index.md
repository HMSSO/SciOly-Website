<h2> What is Science Olympiad? </h2>
<hr />
<p> Science Olympiad is an extracurricular activity where we learn about all forms of science. We compete against other teams, and the competitions are like track meets, with 23 different events. Events are in three major categories: build, test, and lab. Most events are done with a partner. Science Olympiad requires practice, determination, and preparation. </p>

<h2> What are the practices like? </h2>
<hr />
<p>We meet every Monday from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. Currently, all meetings are done virtually, except for build meetings. Studying outside organized practices is encouraged.</p>

<h2>2020 modifications</h2>
<hr>
<p>This season, due to the novel Coronavirus, Science Olympiad has to make some changes. Competitions will be virtual, and build events will not occur at these competitions. However, we will still practice these events as part of a build team. In the list of events below, events with a strikethrough will not occur at competitions, and events with an asterisk have modifications. See the emailed PowerPoint for more information. </p>
