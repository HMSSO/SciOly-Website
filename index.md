<h2> What is Science Olympiad? </h2>
<hr />
<p> Science Olympiad is an extracurricular activity where we learn about all forms of science. We compete against other teams, and the competitions are like track meets, with 23 different events. Events are in three major categories: build, test, and lab. Most events are done with a partner. Science Olympiad requires practice, determination, and preparation. </p>

<h2> What are the practices like? </h2>
<hr />
<p>We meet every Monday from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. Currently, all meetings are done virtually.  Studying outside organized practices is encouraged. We have a build team that meets in person on Fridays.</p>
